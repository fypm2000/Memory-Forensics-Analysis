# Memory-Forensics-Analysis

## Objective

The objective of this project was to conduct a detailed analysis of the provided memory file (KobayashiMaru.vmem) using memory forensics techniques. The primary goal was to identify and investigate potential indicators of malicious activity within the memory dump.

### Skills Learned

- Memory Forensics Analysis: Proficiency in analyzing memory dumps for running processes, command-line executions, and malware artifacts.
- Malicious Activity Identification: Recognition of compromise indicators, abnormal processes, and suspicious command-line activity.
- Command-Line Execution Analysis: Interpretation of command-line actions to detect malicious behavior.
- DLL Analysis: Identification of abnormal or malicious DLLs associated with running processes.
- Malware Detection and Analysis: Detection and analysis of malware artifacts, including hidden processes and code analysis using tools like VirusTotal.

### Tools Used

- SIFT Machines, utilized for memory forensics analysis, equipped with various pre-installed tools and utilities.
- Volatility, open-source memory forensics framework used for extracting information from memory dumps.
- SANS Memory Forensics Cheat Sheet, reference material providing guidance and tips for memory forensics analysis.
- VirusTotal, a online service used for scanning files and URLs to detect malware and malicious activity.
